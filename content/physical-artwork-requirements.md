We have partnered with a CD Duplication & Replication Services provider to offer physical products at reasonable rates to our clients. We are also able to provide Physical Distribution, though this is by separate arrangement - please consult with your Account Manager about this.

For clients utilising our Duplication & Replication services, the requirements are below.

# Artwork Guidelines

You can find detailed spec sheets / templates for all product types at the link below:

All of our spec sheets are sized accurately so if you're using software such as Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator you just need to place our PDF onto one layer and then design your artwork on the layer above.

If you need our help please get in touch. We have a dedicated artwork team that are happy to advise and help wherever possible.

If your artwork has already been designed using someone else's template or spec sheet don't worry. Send it over to us to check, there's every chance we'll be able to use it.

Remember, for best results when printing your files should be 300dpi and CMYK. Once ready we can accept most standard file types but usually we work with Press Quality PDF files. Again, if you have something else we're happy to take a look.
