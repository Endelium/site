[{"content":"We have partnered with a CD Duplication \u0026amp; Replication Services provider to offer physical products at reasonable rates to our clients. We are also able to provide Physical Distribution, though this is by separate arrangement - please consult with your Account Manager about this.\nFor clients utilising our Duplication \u0026amp; Replication services, the requirements are below.\nArtwork Guidelines #Colour #Artwork supplied to us should be in CMYK, Greyscale, or use Pantone Colours. We will not accept artwork in any other colour mode.\nPlease be aware of the amount of ink your artwork holds when trying to achieve dark colours / designs. If your CMYK artwork contains elements that use 90% Cyan, Magenta, Yellow \u0026amp; Black, far too much ink will be applied and there may be drying / saturation issues on press. Therefore, we ask that any elements of your artwork must not contain more than 300% total coverage of the CMYK plates.\nQuality \u0026amp; Resolution #Artwork supplied should hold a minimum resolution of 300dpi - any lower may result in pixilation and/or reduction in image quality.\nAll text supplied on artwork should ideally be in vector form.\nIt is therefore recommended that artwork is designed in packages that support vector graphics like Illustrator or InDesign, rather than using raster-based software like Photoshop.\nTemplates #Please prepare your artwork using the templates that we provide.\nPhotoshop Templates The following will aid you in providing artwork to us correctly:\nThe document size of our supplied templates must not be altered in any way Please drop your artwork onto our template, and not the other way around The template itself must not be modified in any way, and a high resolution PDF should be output Overprint vs Knockout #Those that use Photoshop for all their artwork may ignore this section, as it will not apply.\nIf using Illustrator or InDesign:\nOverprint: The only time overprint should come in to effect is when you overprint black text onto a lighter background; this ensures there are no registration or \u0026lsquo;fit\u0026rsquo; issues. If your text/image is overprinting a lighter shade onto a darker shade, this text/image may not be visible when printed.\nKnockout: This does the opposite to overprint. It knocks elements through the ink beneath it and prints onto the paper. Therefore white text knocking out to a black background will knock through and show the white of the paper/card, therefore making the text perfectly visible.\nA good way to check if any of your artwork is \u0026lsquo;overprinting\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;knocking out\u0026rsquo;, once you have made a PDF, is to open it in Acrobat Professional and use the \u0026lsquo;Overprint Preview\u0026rsquo; feature under the Advanced tab.\nBooklets #Please supply booklet artwork (unless instructed otherwise) in \u0026lsquo;printers pairs\u0026rsquo;, i.e.\n12 \u0026amp; 1 2 \u0026amp; 11 10 \u0026amp; 7 8 \u0026amp; 9 6 \u0026amp; 7 Odd numbered pages sit on the right. If you use this rule, you can apply it to any sized booklet. Please also be aware that the centre pages should be the last pages on your document.\nCD Onbodies #Please ensure your onbody artwork does not include a centre hole or stacking ring. We will grid this artwork accordingly.\nFonts #If the situation arises where you will need to supply us with source files, we will require all fonts that you have used, too.\nIf \u0026lsquo;TrueType\u0026rsquo; fonts (TTFs) are used, they generally come in two parts: a printer file and a screen file. In order for us to use your fonts successfully, we will require you to supply both of these elements. Failure to supply one part of the font can result in font corruption/bitmapping, or complete font replacement to something standard such as Courier.\nPlease also ensure that you embed any fonts into your document when supplying PDF files.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/clients/physical-artwork-requirements/","section":"Welcome to Endelium","summary":"","title":"Physical Artwork Requirements"},{"content":"The quality of all releases distributed through Endelium is of the utmost importance to us.
